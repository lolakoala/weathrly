# Weathrly

Live Site: http://www.robbieg.io/weathrly/

This is a weather application built with React.  We utilize the weather underground API to fetch current weather data for a given city.  Also implemented is an autocomplete feature that I built previously.

To install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To fire up a development server:

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run your application.
* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/test.html` to run your test suite in the browser.

To build the static files:

```js
npm run build
```


To run tests in Node:

```js
npm test
```
